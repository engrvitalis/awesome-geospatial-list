## Tools

Various awesome tools for geospatial work

- [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/) - A Free and Open Source Geographic Information System - Awesome for viewing raster and vector data.
- [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) - For editing visual (non-analytic) raster products.
- [GeoJSON.io](https://geojson.io/) - Online GeoJSON viewer/editor.

## Libraries

Awesome libraries to support geospatial development

- [GDAL](https://gdal.org/) - Geospatial Data Abstraction Library - C/C++ library with Python bindings and helpful command line tools for handling many raster and vector geospatial data formats.
- [Rasterio](https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio) - Python package for reading/writing raster datasets, based on GDAL.
- [Shapely](https://github.com/Toblerity/Shapely) - Python package for manipulation and analysis of planar geometric objects, based on GEOS.
- [GEOS](https://trac.osgeo.org/geos/) - GEOS (Geometry Engine - Open Source) is a C++ port of the â€‹Java Topology Suite (JTS).


## Data

### Public Datasets

Data that is publicly available at no extra cost (access fees may apply for AWS/GCP)

- [Copernicus](https://www.copernicus.eu/en/access-data) - European Space Agency (ESA) provides vast amounts of public data, most notably Sentinel-1 for radar and Sentinel-2 for optical satellite data.
- [Landsat](https://www.usgs.gov/land-resources/nli/landsat/landsat-data-access) - Earth-observation satellites from the USGS.
- [AWS Earth](https://aws.amazon.com/earth/) - Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides several datasets, including Landsat 8, Sentinel-2, NEXRAD, OpenStreetMap, and more.
